My place to experiment with the features of Git and GitHub.  
Added this line for my first commit on branch "readme-edits".  
Added this line for my first commit on the "main" branch.  
(Accepted the changes of both branches during the resolve of the conflict.)  
The user "Gere-uebt" added this line on his fork.  
The user "Gere-uebt" added this line on a branch of his fork.  
Gerhard-Wonner added this line on his "main" branch.  
("Gere-uebt" resolved the conflict while merging to the fork of "Gerhard-Wonner". He combined the changes of both main-branches.)  
The user "Gere-uebt" added this line on his fork and tries to convince the project owner to include it. Communication via GitHub-issue.
